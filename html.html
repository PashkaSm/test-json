<b>1. Adoption of the Agenda</b>

The agenda for this meeting was adopted.


<b>2. Approval of the minutes of the meeting dated 6 February 2019</b>

The minutes dated 6th of February 2019 were approved.

<b>3. Review of Uncollected Assessment Table</b>

The table of uncollected assessments was reviewed. The Secretariat received a payment from Cameroon for 2016-17 assessment. The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR stated that he would send a message to Cameroon’s Coordinating Agency notifying them that the membership of Cameron would be reinstated on the 1st of July and the money that Cameroon still owed would be distributed over five years. The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR explained that the assessment figure for Cameroon appeared on the current budget because the assessments were approved before the country was suspended. <em>The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR noted that there needed to be a system set up that identified members that were in danger of being suspended, so they would not be included in the budget. The CHAIR agreed and said that he would raise this concern and that members that were in arrears for over two years should not be included in the budget.</em>

The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR gave a synopsis of all the members that were in arrears. It was discussed that Sudan was in danger of being suspended. It was indicated that Sudan had had difficulties with transferring payments due to sanctions. <em>The CHAIR informed the subcommittee that the sanctions have been lifted, but if Sudan was still having difficulties with money transfer, the CHAIR suggested transferring money through FAO.</em>

The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR indicated that he was also concerned about Mozambique since the Secretariat only received a partial payment for 2017-18 and Sudan was still in arrears for the current year.

The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR and the CHAIR discussed the question of tax reimbursement to ICAC. The ICAC would pay taxes of staff members who were responsible for paying taxes in the U.S., the State Department would then reimburse ICAC the money that was spent. The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR indicated that currently, the ICAC had been receiving only 60% of the money that was spent on taxes since only federal taxes would get reimbursed and not state taxes. <em>It was decided that this issue must be raised with the State Department.</em>

The CHAIR and the EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR discussed what could be the reasons for members not submitting their payments. The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR informed the CHAIR that he recently visited the embassy of Uganda and spoke with the delegate. He noted that the delegate was not well aware about the activities that ICAC was involved in. It was noted that the attendance of the Standing Committee meetings had increased. <em>It was suggested that ICAC could organise an annual reception for all the delegates in order to encourage communication between members of the Standing Committee. The CHAIR suggested that the reception can take place around World Cotton Day. The reception could take place in one of the embassies.</em>

The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR informed the committee that he would be going to Benin and would meet with the President of Benin, Mr Patrice Talon. Since the World Cotton Day would be launched by President Talon, it would be important for Benin to be a member of ICAC. The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR was in communication with Benin officials and indicated that an agreement was reached about the payment of the assessments that Benin had in arrears. It was agreed that Benin would pay for two years that were in arrears. The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR informed the committee that he would also be traveling to Ethiopia where he would be meeting with the ministers who he had been in communication with regarding potential membership. He added that Ms Lorena Ruiz, the ICAC economist had been in communication with Mexico regarding its potential membership. The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR asked the CHAIR if he would speak with his contacts in Mexico and in Vietnam.


<b>4. Review budget and assessment fees for 2019</b>

The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR presented the proposed budget for 2019-20. There was an uplift in salaries that went up 2.5% in line with inflation. However, the overall figure for salaries had decreased because one of the members of staff had left the organisation. The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR noted that it was discovered that the formula for calculating ICAC staff salaries was taken from the formula used by the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development. It was discovered that such organization no longer existed, and the calculations were out of date. The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR noted that pension compensations didn’t match among the staff. It was agreed that the ICAC needed realignment and transparency to calculate pension scales. It was also noted that the Secretariat was working out the system for bonuses that would be offered to the staff from the revenue generated from the Business Plan.

The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR explained that the figure for salaries for the next year is lower because one of the staff member’s left. This staff member would be replaced by a part-time staff member. The Sub-committee then reviewed proposed trips for the Secretariat. The trips were coded according to their priority. It was also indicated which trips had been budgeted under the Business Plan. Travel Budget had increased from $53,613 to $61,540.

The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR spoke about the Business Plan and stated that at this point, the Secretariat received $164K from Business Plan activities. The revenue from Publications would be expected to decrease because the Secretariat decided to allow some publications to be available for free in order to raise ICAC’s visibility. The revenue from sponsorship trade booths in Australia had been projected to be $40,000. It was noted that Cote d’Ivoire had not paid their share of the sponsorship revenue that was agreed upon, which was $40,000.

The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR indicated that the Soil and Plant Health App is being developed that would be launched in April and would be ready for an official launch during the World Cotton Day. It was noted that there should be a distance between the sponsors of the app and the farmers. It was also suggested that when discussing the development of the app and similar projects, it would be good to indicate the total price of the project to highlight the importance of projects that the ICAC had been involved in.

The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR noted that the CHAIR of the Standing Committee would like the projects to be discussed and approved during the Standing Committee meetings. <em>It was proposed to have an update of projects as a standing item on the Standing Committee Meeting agenda.</em> The Sub-committee was informed that there would be a demo of the Soil and Plant Health App in April.

The EXECTIVE DIRECTOR presented the proposed assessment calculations based on the budget. He noted that he fulfilled his promise not to increase the equal contribution portion of the assessment. He noted that the current budget was very tight and had been calculated as closely as possible to actual figures. It was suggested that the flights for the Plenary Meeting should be booked in advance in order to stay within the budget on travel expenses.

The Subcommittee discussed the ICAC reserves. The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR noted that the question of the reserves had not been looked at since 2011. He suggested that there should be a discussion about this topic. The reserve should cover costs associated with liquidating the company. It was also recently discovered that there had been a security deposit put into a savings account by the landlord on behalf of ICAC. It was discussed that other commodity bodies have four months of operating costs in the reserves. <em>The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR suggests having six months of operating costs in the reserves. The CHAIR also suggested having a fund for cash flow buffer.</em>

<b>5. Any other business</b>

The CHAIR asked if there was any other business to discuss, there being none the meeting was adjourned.
